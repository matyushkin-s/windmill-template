Please, estimate it and let us know how much time you need for accomplishing this task.
If you haven't Photoshop, you can use any Online editors, for example - https://www.photopea.com/

1. You need to create HTML markup for header and menu (PSD file: Menu.psd, image: images/default.jpg)
2. The menu should have 2 positions:

- Click on the menu icon - show the line with icons. (PSD layer: Compressed, image: images/menu-click.jpg)
- Hover on the line with icons - show the Text next to each icon. (PSD layer: Expanded, image: images/line-hover.jpg)

3. The font for icons should be 'icomoon'. You need to add this font and apply icons. (Demo for icons and Fonts files provided in a given folder 'icomoon').
4. 'Roboto' font - from Google Fonts.
